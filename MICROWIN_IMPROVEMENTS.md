# MicroWin Improvements Summary

## Latest Enhancements (Focus on Mount Permission Issues)

### 1. Privilege Elevation System
- **Windows API Integration**: Added P/Invoke declarations for Windows API functions to enable system privileges
- **Required Privileges**: Automatically enables SeBackupPrivilege, SeRestorePrivilege, SeSecurityPrivilege, SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege, SeManageVolumePrivilege
- **Privilege Status Monitoring**: Real-time checking and reporting of current privilege status
- **Alternative Methods**: Fallback to PowerShell's Enable-Privilege if available

### 2. Pre-Mount System Checks
- **DISM Availability**: Verifies DISM is installed and responsive
- **Disk Space Monitoring**: Checks available space on target drive (warns if < 10GB)
- **Directory Access Testing**: Validates write permissions to scratch directory
- **System Architecture Detection**: Reports process and OS architecture for compatibility
- **DISM-Compatible Permissions**: Automatically applies optimal file permissions to scratch directories

### 3. Enhanced Mount Process
- **Retry Logic**: Up to 3 attempts with cleanup between retries
- **Multiple Methods**: Primary DISM command-line, fallback to PowerShell cmdlets
- **Better Error Capture**: Redirected output to log files for detailed error analysis
- **Stale Mount Cleanup**: Automatic cleanup of previous mount points before starting
- **Multiple Scratch Directories**: Automatically tries different locations (temp, C:\temp, C:\MicrowinMount)
- **Permission Application**: Applies DISM-compatible permissions to all scratch directories

### 4. Comprehensive Error Reporting
- **System State Display**: Shows administrator status, current user, architecture
- **Current Privileges**: Lists all security privileges and their status
- **Step-by-Step Troubleshooting**: Detailed manual steps for users to follow
- **Manual Command Examples**: Exact commands users can run to test independently
- **Alternative Approaches**: Multiple workaround suggestions

### 5. Performance Optimizations (Previous)
- **Process Priority**: Elevated to High priority for faster processing
- **Memory Optimization**: Increased working set for better performance
- **Multi-Core Detection**: Utilizes all available CPU cores
- **Fast Compression**: Uses fastest compression settings for speed

### 6. Debug and Monitoring Improvements
- **Extensive Logging**: Debug output at every major step
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress updates via taskbar
- **Error Context**: Detailed error messages with context
- **Verification Steps**: Multiple methods to verify successful operations

## Key Files Modified
- `functions/microwin/Invoke-WPFMicroWinRunspace.ps1` - Main runspace with all improvements
- `functions/microwin/Invoke-Microwin.ps1` - Entry point with runspace integration
- `functions/microwin/Invoke-MicrowinGetIso.ps1` - ISO selection with UI thread safety
- `functions/microwin/Set-ScratchFolderPermissions.ps1` - Standalone script to apply DISM-compatible permissions

## Testing Recommendations
1. **Administrator Rights**: Always run as Administrator
2. **Antivirus**: Temporarily disable real-time protection during testing
3. **Clean Environment**: Run `dism /cleanup-mountpoints` before starting
4. **Monitor Output**: Watch console for detailed debug information
5. **Manual Verification**: Use provided manual commands if automated process fails

## Troubleshooting Steps (If Mount Still Fails)
1. Check Event Viewer for DISM-related errors
2. Verify Windows ADK/DISM tools are properly installed
3. Test with different scratch directory locations
4. Run from elevated Command Prompt instead of PowerShell
5. Check Group Policy restrictions on DISM operations
6. Ensure no other processes are using the WIM file
7. **NEW: Use the standalone permission script**: `.\functions\microwin\Set-ScratchFolderPermissions.ps1 -Path "C:\temp\mount" -ShowPermissions`
8. **NEW: Disable Windows Defender real-time protection** (most common cause of permission issues)

## Expected Behavior
- Clear privilege status reporting
- Detailed pre-mount system checks
- Retry logic with cleanup between attempts
- Comprehensive error messages with actionable steps
- Progress updates throughout the process
- Graceful failure handling with detailed troubleshooting guidance
